## What this is

This is an example application I wrote for an article about CouchDB and Rails in the german [RailsWay](http://it-republik.de/railsway) magazine. It's a _very_ simple photo hosting site that allows users to upload their photos into CouchDB (including binary data), tag them and then browser a list of all photos and a tag cloud.

The application is based on my CouchDB/Ruby framework called [Couch Potato](http://github.com/langalex/couch_potato).

This application requires Ruby 1.9 to run.
